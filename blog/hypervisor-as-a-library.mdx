Before we dive into the topic, let me introduce you my new friend `catsay`, a simple Go program which eats stdin and speaks like a cat:

![catsay](/media/hypervisor-as-a-library/catsay.png)

Cute! ... but it's not what I want to talk about. What makes this screenshot very exciting is, it's a Linux lightweight virtual machine running on [Starina operating system](https://starina.dev/)!

That said, this post is not about how hard it is to write a hypervisor (see [my previous post](/blog/riscv-hypervisor) for that). In fact, it's not that hard. The hardest part is to design how you interact with the hypervisor. In other words, designing the hypervisor API. Starina needs an attractive integration with Linux.

In this post, I'd share a design pattern: **hypervisor as a library**.

## How do we run Linux apps in Linux today?

First, if you were to write a Rust application which uses `catsay`, how do you integrate?

In Rust, you would use [`std::process::Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) to run `catsay`:

```rust
Command::new("/bin/catsay")
    .stdin(stdin)
    .spawn()
```

If you want to pass an environment variable, just add a single line:

```rust {3}
Command::new("/bin/catsay")
    .stdin(stdin)
    .env("CATSAY_MODE", "dog")
    .spawn()
```

Nice. If you're interested in its output, add another parameter `.stdout`:

```rust {4}
let child = Command::new("/bin/catsay")
    .stdin(stdin)
    .env("CATSAY_MODE", "dog")
    .stdout(Stdio::piped())
    .spawn()
```

It's boringly obvious, right? However, on another OS like Starina, it's not obvious how to provide a Linux environment, or Linux compatibility.

## Linux compatibility

Providing Linux compatibility is a challenging task, and there are some ways to achieve it. A popular way is to run Linux binaries as kinda *in native*: hook system calls and emulate them. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 1) and FreeBSD Linuxulator are examples.

In Starina, I took a different approach: **run the real Linux kernel in a lightweight virtual machine**.

It might sound extreme, but it's already proven to be practical by WSL2. It has a huge drawback in the cloud computing environment where hardware-assisted virtualization is not available (or is slow) in cheap VM-based instances, but it's still attractive for Starina:

- The interface between Linux and Starina is clearer: Virtio virtual devices.
- Unlike FreeBSD, Starina is not that similar to Linux. Especially, I don't have a good idea to implement `fork(2)` efficiently without adding a tailor-made logic to the microkernel.
- It is the genuine Linux kernel. No need to implement Linux system calls one by one, nor to discover every lesser-known features like *auxiliary vector*.

## `std::process::Command` for Linux VM

So, running the real Linux kernel in a lightweight VM sounds technically possible. However, how do we actually use it? My answer is, follow the `std::process::Command` pattern!

Here's how you can run `catsay` in Starina:

```rust
use core::str::from_utf8;

use starina::prelude::*;
use starina_linux::BufferedStdin;
use starina_linux::BufferedStdout;

pub fn catsay(text: &str) {
    let stdin = BufferedStdin::new(text);
    let stdout = BufferedStdout::new();

    starina_linux::Command::new("/bin/catsay")
        .stdin(stdin)
        .stdout(stdout.clone())
        .spawn()
        .expect("failed to execute process");

    info!("{}", from_utf8(&stdout.buffer()).unwrap());
}
```

Doesn't it look familiar?

## How the hypervisor works

Under the hood, `starina_linux::Command` creates a lightweight VM using Starina's `HvSpace` (guest-physical address space) and `vCPU` (virtual CPU) APIs.

Here's a simplified version of `starina_linux::Command`:

```rust
let mut virtio_fs = VirtioFs::new();
virtio_fs.add_file("/stdin", stdin);
virtio_fs.add_file("/stdout", stdout);

let ram = Folio::allocate(MEMORY_SIZE); // folio = a memory region
install_device_tree(&mut ram);
extract_linux_image(&mut ram, include_bytes!("linux.bin"));

let hvspace = HvSpace::new();
let vcpu = Vcpu::new(&hvspace);
loop {
    let exit = vcpu.run();
    match exit {
        Reboot => {
            break;
        }
        PageFault { gpaddr, data } if gpaddr.is_in_mmio() => {
            virtio_fs.handle_mmio_access(gpaddr, data);
        }
        _ => {
            panic!("unexpected VM exit reason: {:?}", exit);
        }
    }
}
```

In a nutshell, create a guest-physical address space, install Linux kernel into it, enter the VM world, and handle MMIO accesses.

Isn't it surprisingly simple? Linux KVM API also works in the similar way. Hypervisor is generally a very simple program (otherwise we would not trust it as a security boundary).

You might notice a mysterious `virtio_fs` object. As its name suggests, it's a virtual file system to provide a seamless integration with Starina. In Linux, stdin you provide is accessible as `/virtfs/stdin` and our custom init connects it to `catsay`.

## Hypervisor as a library

A hypervisor, more specifically virtual machine monitor (VMM) such as QEMU and Firecracker, is typically used as a separate process. Your control plane program talks to them over an IPC mechanism. Having a process isolation is a good thing for security, but it limits the flexibility of integration and performance.

Starina takes a different approach: `starina_linux::Command` hypervisor is provided as a library. It sounds weird but it's very satisfying to use:

```rust
struct YourVirtualFile;

impl FileLike for YourVirtualFile {
    // Similar to std::io::Read, but with an offset and
    // a zero-copy writer.
    fn read_at(
        &self,
        offset: usize,
        size: usize,
        completer: ReadCompleter,
    ) -> ReadResult {
        // This writes into the virtio's buffer directly!
        completer.complete(b"Hello, world!")
    }
}

starina_linux::Command::new("/bin/catsay")
    .stdin(Arc::new(YourVirtualFile))
    .spawn();
```

In this snippet, `YourVirtualFile` is a file-like object that is used as `catsay`'s stdin. Doesn't it look similar to `std::io::Read` trait?

Thanks to the hypervisor-as-a-library design, you can pass a Rust object (`YourVirtualFile`) to `catsay` transparently, and what's more you can write into the guest memory directly, in a safe way!

To put it differently, virtualization is not only for emulating hardwares to run an existing OS as it is, but also for **designing how you interact with the guest OS** through clear interfaces like Virtio. In hypervisor-as-a-library, you should consider the guest OS as a library. Well then, how do you design the library API?

## Is embedding Linux VM into apps a good idea?

Virtual machines are often considered slow and heavy, but they are not necessarily so. The guest Linux runs natively without VMM's intervention most of time. VMM's job is to emulate few virtio devices, and it's still very simple: virtio is just a command queue with interrupts.

Starina's Linux image is embedded into each application for the time being, but is only 6.7 MB (64-bit RISC-V). The minimal memory space required is around 32MB. It takes 2 seconds to boot in QEMU software emulation.

To be fair, I haven't invested my time to optimize it yet. I'm pretty sure it can be optimized to less than 100ms (in QEMU), or even less than 10ms with VM snapshotting (again, in QEMU's software emulation!).

You might wonder why it doesn't share a single VM instance across multiple applications. That of course makes sense to me, but hypervisor-as-a-library has a potential to start your Linux apps faster even than the native Linux environment with VM snapshotting, which would be easier to develop compared to [Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace](https://criu.org/Main_Page) thanks to clear VMM interface.

I haven't achieved low latency yet (famous last words), but I'm very optimistic about its practicality. So the answer is, yes, I think it's a good idea!

## What's next?

`starina_linux::Command` is a very simple API to provide Linux compatibility in Starina. However, it's still not feature-complete. It lacks networking (virtio-net), an persistent storage, and more.

My dream is to have more container-like experience on Starina. Here's what it might look like:

```rust
starina_linux::Command::new("node")
  .arg("/app/server.js")
  .env("NODE_ENV", "production")
  // What if Starina supports the container images out of the box?
  .image("docker.io/library/node:24-alpine")
  // Use VM state caching to start faster (if it's safe to do so).
  .snapshot(true)
  // Pass a channel connected to Starina FS server.
  .mount("/app", dir_ch)
  // Export a TCP port to the Starina TCP/IP server.
  .expose(Export {
    host: tcp_listen_ch,
    guest: 80,
  })
  .spawn();
```

Linux compatibility does not only mean running Linux binaries. It also means it unlocks **Linux device drivers on Starina**, thanks to its microkernel design. I haven't yet looked into it, but it's a very interesting idea.
