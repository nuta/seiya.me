Since I had a plenty of time during the holidays, I enjoyed creating a new programming language.

## Why another programming language?

To demonstrate how you can easily develop my new microkernel-based operating system, I needed an embeddable scripting language that is intuitive for experienced programmers.

## Design goals

To explain in a single word: *boring*. The language has no challenging features, is not performant, but is easy to learn and write.

## How does it look like?


## Performance

It's very slow!

## What's next?
