I've finished translating my online book ["Writing an OS in 1,000 Lines"](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/) into English. The book is about creating an OS from scratch in 1,000 lines of code, written for beginners who are interested in systems programming.

1,000 lines may sound like too few to build an OS, but it's enough to cover the essential parts of an OS. In the book, we will implement:

- Multi-tasking to run multiple applications.
- Paging (process memory isolation).
- Exception handler.
- System call handler.
- A virtio-blk device driver to read and write a disk.
- Command-line shell.

Hope you enjoy it! Feel free to ask me any questions or give feedback [on GitHub](https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines) :)
